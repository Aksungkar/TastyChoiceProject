TastyChoice is a website that specializes to store and generate recipes based on the availability of those ingredients that the user has at the time of browsing. The purpose of this software is to make recipe searching much easier for people. This site is especially useful for those with limited time or quantity of products. Also, the search for a recipe depends on the complexity selected by the user. Thus, the recipes are selected exclusively according to the parameters adjusted to the user.
